# 2hongo for Claude

Teach and practice Japanese in Claude, grounded in [2hongo](https://www.2hongo.com)'s dictionary.

The plugin has two halves. A **skill** teaches Claude how to explain, correct, and drill Japanese
consistently — it needs no 2hongo account and works entirely from the conversation. An
**MCP connector** adds 2hongo's stored dictionary data, so readings, meanings, curated examples,
JLPT level, and frequency come from a source rather than from recall.

## Install

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add 2hongo/plugins
claude plugin install 2hongo@twolexis
```

Prefer no plugin? The same tools are available as a custom remote connector — add
`https://www.2hongo.com/api/mcp` as a custom connector in Claude and skip the package entirely.

## Account and authentication

The teaching skill works immediately, with no account.

Every 2hongo tool, the dictionary included, requires a **free** 2hongo account; until the server
is connected, Claude sees no 2hongo tools at all. Connect it from `/plugin` (or the connector
settings in Claude): the 2hongo authorization page opens, you sign in or create an account and
approve the connection. There is no subscription step and no upgrade prompt in that flow — an
existing paid subscription is simply recognized. A connection lasts 30 days, after which you
connect again.

The connection uses OAuth 2.1 with PKCE. Access tokens are short-lived and limited to the
permissions you approved. To end the connection, revoke it on 2hongo under Account Settings >
Sessions > Connected AI assistants; access stops on the next request. 2hongo never receives
your Claude conversation — only the specific word or query a tool call carries.

## Try it

```
Break down 「昨日は友達と映画を見に行った」 for me. I'm around N4.
```

```
Look up 込む in 2hongo and show me the readings and a couple of real examples.

The account tools read or change your 2hongo account, so Claude asks for those permissions separately
when you connect — a connection that only searches the dictionary never gets them.

`get_content_brief` is told only whether Claude is writing a story, a dialogue,
examples, or an explanation — never what it is about. Claude writes the text; 2hongo supplies what
to weave in.

The tools follow the same plans as the website. Every account reads the dictionary and the full
grammar reference at every JLPT level. Word audio, and recording study progress on grammar and kanji,
cover N5 and kana on a free account and every level from Standard. Meaning search has a daily
allowance that grows with the plan. `get_learner_profile` returns your own settings and editable
learning profile on any account; the stage and progress it derives from your study record come with
Plus and Max. Personalized practice selection, reading checks, and writing briefs follow the same
boundary. Progress insights follow it too, and explicitly leave accuracy unavailable where 2hongo
does not yet keep per-review history. JLPT readiness follows the same boundary and reports only
coverage of 2hongo's inventory — never a test score or pass prediction. Submitting practice results
is available on every plan. `record_usage_evidence` follows the personalization boundary. It
stores only the word or grammar sense, result, optional issue category, day, and calling client —
never the learner's sentence — after the learner is told. Every entry appears under Account Settings
→ Learning Profile → AI assistant activity and can be deleted there. Repeated mapped grammar evidence
can update a checked Basics chapter and refresh an existing Sensei plan; it never moves an SRS schedule.
The tools say when you have hit one of those boundaries;
they never offer to sell you anything.

Word recordings play on 2hongo: `get_word` links to the word's page when your plan includes its
recording, and leaves the link out otherwise.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Connect a free 2hongo account", or Claude says it can't reach 2hongo** — the server isn't
  connected, the 30-day connection lapsed, or it was revoked. Re-authorize the plugin from
  `/plugin`, or reconnect the connector. Setup steps for each app:
  [2hongo.com/en/help/ai-assistants](https://www.2hongo.com/en/help/ai-assistants#connect).
- **A word isn't found** — Claude resolves conjugated forms to the dictionary form before looking
  a word up, but it can miss. Ask it to search the dictionary form directly — 見に行った → 行く.
- **Claude answers without consulting 2hongo** — that is the skill working as designed for generic
  explanation. Ask it to look the word up in 2hongo when you want sourced data.
